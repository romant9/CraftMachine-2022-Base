## Importing the Plugin


You can follow the standard <a href="/README.md#importing-the-plugin">Importing the Plugin</a> process. With a few changes here when <a href="#running-the-samples">running the samples</a> and <a href="#configuring-the-plugin">configuring the plugin</a>.
> [!WARNING]
> If you choose the tarball method, when downloading the release on mac it may convert the `.tgz` into a `.tar` which is not compatible with unity. Changing the file extension back to a `.tgz` should fix this.

## Samples

You can follow the standard <a href="/README.md#samples">Samples</a> process.   
Please note the details in the <a href="#running-the-samples">Running the samples</a> section when running the samples from a build for Android.  

> [!WARNING] 
> The Social Overlay is not implemented yet. However, the Ecom Overlay is supported on mobile as of EOS Unity Plugin 4.1.0.

## Running the samples

When following the steps to <a href="/README.md#running-the-samples">run a sample</a> from a build for Android, follow the Unity doc for <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-sdksetup.html">Debugging on an Android device</a>, to connect your device to the engine.  
This will allow the smoother ```Build And Run``` option to work instead of just using the ```Build``` button.  

When running on a device you may need to <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable">enable developer mode</a> on the device, then <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#Enable-debugging">Enable USB debugging on your device</a>, as well as accepting any popups that appear on the phone during the process.

## Configuring the Plugin
